This is a program that generates random chords from a list of all possible chords. It also has definitions of 
chords and intervals to help you form a chord if you are stuck. I am thinking about turning this into a game.
I am developing it for Pythonista on iphone because it is much more convient to read off your phone when you
are at a piano. 

When I play jazz piano, I always had a hard time site reading those really complicated chords on time. I would 
basically have to take the charts home and commit them to memory (that's a git joke), which takes can take awhile 
if you have bad musical memory. Knowing your chords is imperative to improvising, so I created this program to practice 
nailing chords on the fly so I could site read charts in time. Also, I am a songwriter and composer and I found it
useful to be able to generate completely random chord progression using this program, rather than chords that have a
natural progression which most chord progression generaters do. This program should be great for any jazz musician to 
practice some intense scales and anyone who is in the process of learning music theory. 

Hope you enjoy!
